==========

Various methods for Monitoring stats from a Seneye (www.seneye.com) Aquarium Unit via the Seneye API.

The plan is to have code for:

* Providing alerting to an OMD/Check_MK Instance written in Perl
* Providing alerting to an OMD/Check_MK Instance written in Python
* Provide Nagios checks in some form or another :)
