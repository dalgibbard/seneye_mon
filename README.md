seneye_mon
==========

Python code for Monitoring the statistics from a Seneye (www.seneye.com) Aquarium Unit via the Seneye API.

The plan is to have code for:

Initial/Legacy:
* Providing alerting to an OMD/Check_MK Instance written in Perl
 
Moving Forward:
* Providing a joint codebase for alerting to an OMD/Check_MK OR Nagios Instance (without Passive results!) written in Python
